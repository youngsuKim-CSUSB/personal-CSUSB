I am an assistant professor at California State University San Bernardino in the department of mathematics. Formerly, I was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Arkansas and University of California Riverside. I earned my PhD from Purdue University under the guidance of Prof. Bernd Ulrich.  My main interest is commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
