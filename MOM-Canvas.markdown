## A summary of how to add MyOpenMath to CSUSB Canvas LMS

The method explained is to add a MyOpenMath course to Canvas. 
Students do not need to create an account, but they need to put their names once. 
The grade book does not sync automatically.
Please visit the [official webpage](https://www.myopenmath.com/help.php?section=lti) for details.

Caveat: If you want to import each assignment (this method syncs grades automatically), follow these [instructions](https://express.adobe.com/page/cKaquR5CpbyyQ/).
